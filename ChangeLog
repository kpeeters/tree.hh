2008-08-28  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Released 2.62

	* Changed the behaviour of max_depth() so that it returns -1 for

2008-06-30  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Released 2.52

	* Made depth member function static so it can be used independent
	of an actual tree, and added a version with two iterators to
	measure depths relative to a different node.

2008-02-28  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

                  / \
                  F G

	  when asked for the first node at depth 3 from 'A' (since it
	  failed to go back up the tree from 'D').

2007-08-21  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Released 2.31.

	* Added GPL version 3 licensing as an option.

2007-01-19  Kasper Peeters  <kasper@pooh>

2006-11-29  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Release 2.3.

	Fixed a bug in number_of_siblings which only counted siblings in
	one direction (thanks to Fanzhe Cui for pointing this out).

	* Fixed move_before to work when the target is a sibling_iterator
	pointing to the end of a range of siblings.

2005-11-20  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Added move_after, which for some mysterious reason was
	missing. Thanks to Dennis Jones for pointing this out.

	* Fixed a bug in operator++ for post_order iterators
	(skip_children could remain set if no next sibling present).
	Thanks to Ohad for pointing out the bug.

2005-10-12  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Fixed kp::destructor -> destructor.

	* Moved body of 'compare_nodes::operator()' into the class
	declaration in order to satisfy buggy Borland compilers (and stop

	Epstein for the patch).

2004-02-04  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Released 1.106

2003-06-25  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Many bug fixes for fixed depth iterators, thanks to Ruben
	Niederhagen for pointing out several problems (a few still exist,

2003-04-17  Kasper Peeters  <kasper.peeters@aei.mpg.de>

	* Released 1.85

	* Corrected return type of operator++ and friends.

	* Released 1.83

	* Changed return type of 'child' member function to be a sibling
	iterator instead of a reference to the actual node (sorry for the
	incompatibility with previous versions). Change also propagated to
	tree_msvc.hh.
	
2003-02-07    <kasper@whiteroom2.localdomain>

	* Released 1.80

	* Released 1.78.

	* Fixed a bug in sort, which resulted in a corrupt tree (thanks to
	Michael Vogt for fixing this bug).

2003-01-07  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon25.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Released 1.75 and msvc version 1.72

	sibling_iterators (thanks to Tony Cook for pointing this out).

2002-11-15  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon25.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

        * Released 1.72
	
	* Fixed a bug in 'index' when called on nodes at the top level of
	the tree (thanks to David Zajic for the bug report). Be warned
	that the top level is a bit special at the moment; the end
	sibling_iterator is ill-defined for siblings there (to be fixed in
	a future version).

2002-10-31  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@sshserv.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Released 1.70.

	* Finished the merge algorithm, updated the documentation with
	examples about its use, and added a test-case to the test_tree.cc
	program.

	* Fixed a bug in pre_order_iterator::operator--.

2002-10-20  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon24.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Released 1.66.

2002-10-15  Kasper Peeters  <kasper@whiteroom.nikhef.nl>

	* Code for post_order_iterator implemented.

2002-10-13  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon24.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Rewrote large parts of the code to allow for multiple iterator
	types, such as pre_order_iterator (which was the previous iterator
	type), post_order_iterator and so on. This required small changes
	to the interface, the most visible one being

	   - insert(iterator, iterator) for the insertion of a subtree
	     is now called insert_subtree(iterator, iterator).

	Apologies if this breaks your code.

2002-10-11  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon24.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Removed '(void)' type declarations in favour of the C++ standard
	empty brackets '()'.

2002-10-10  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon24.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Added 'index' in response to a discussion on the Boost mailing
	list. 

2002-10-03  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* reparent(iterator,sibling_iterator,sibling_iterator) now accepts
	an empty range, in which case it does nothing (request by Jos de
	Laender).

	* Fixed a bug in the iterator(sibling_iterator) constructor
	(thanks to Jos de Laender for pointing this out).

2002-09-04  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Fixed a bug in insert_after (thanks to Carl Blanchette for the
	patch).

2002-08-29  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* The problem in test_tree of the previous item was actually do to
	tree::end(iterator) returning the end of the tree, not the end of
	the current sibling list. Fixed now, released 1.55.

2002-08-26  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Released 1.54.

	* Printing a single-node tree in test_tree would result in a
	segfault; more robust now (thanks to Yutaka Sato for the bug
	report).
	
2002-05-07  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Fixed a bug in "sort" which would remove duplicate nodes altogether.

2002-03-24  Kasper Peeters  <kasper@whiteroom.nikhef.nl>

	* Added "append_child" without child argument, to add empty child
	node.

2002-05-04  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Released 1.45.

	* Removed restriction of having only a single node at the top of
	the tree (associated with this, the top nodes should now be inserted
	with "insert", not with "append_child").

	* Fixes for ISO compatibility (now works with gcc-3.1). Thanks to
	Olivier Verdier.
