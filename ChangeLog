	* Released 2.52

                  / \
                  F G

	  when asked for the first node at depth 3 from 'A' (since it

	* Changed return type of 'child' member function to be a sibling
	iterator instead of a reference to the actual node (sorry for the
	incompatibility with previous versions). Change also propagated to
	tree_msvc.hh.
	
2003-02-07    <kasper@whiteroom2.localdomain>

	* Released 1.80

	* Fixed a bug in sort, which resulted in a corrupt tree (thanks to
	Michael Vogt for fixing this bug).

        * Released 1.72
	
	* Fixed a bug in 'index' when called on nodes at the top level of
	the tree (thanks to David Zajic for the bug report). Be warned
	that the top level is a bit special at the moment; the end
	sibling_iterator is ill-defined for siblings there (to be fixed in
	a future version).

2002-10-31  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@sshserv.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Released 1.70.

	* Finished the merge algorithm, updated the documentation with
	examples about its use, and added a test-case to the test_tree.cc

2002-10-20  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon24.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Released 1.66.

	* Code for post_order_iterator implemented.

2002-10-13  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon24.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Rewrote large parts of the code to allow for multiple iterator
	types, such as pre_order_iterator (which was the previous iterator
	type), post_order_iterator and so on. This required small changes
	to the interface, the most visible one being

	   - insert(iterator, iterator) for the insertion of a subtree
	     is now called insert_subtree(iterator, iterator).

	Apologies if this breaks your code.

2002-10-11  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon24.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Removed '(void)' type declarations in favour of the C++ standard
	empty brackets '()'.

2002-10-10  Kasper Peeters  <peekas@xeon24.aei-potsdam.mpg.de>

	* Added 'index' in response to a discussion on the Boost mailing
	list. 

2002-10-03  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* reparent(iterator,sibling_iterator,sibling_iterator) now accepts
	an empty range, in which case it does nothing (request by Jos de
	Laender).

	(thanks to Jos de Laender for pointing this out).

2002-09-04  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	patch).

2002-08-29  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* The problem in test_tree of the previous item was actually do to
	tree::end(iterator) returning the end of the tree, not the end of
	the current sibling list. Fixed now, released 1.55.

2002-08-26  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Released 1.54.

	* Printing a single-node tree in test_tree would result in a
	segfault; more robust now (thanks to Yutaka Sato for the bug
	report).
	
2002-05-07  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Fixed a bug in "sort" which would remove duplicate nodes altogether.

2002-03-24  Kasper Peeters  <kasper@whiteroom.nikhef.nl>

	* Added "append_child" without child argument, to add empty child
	node.

2002-05-04  Kasper Peeters  <K.Peeters@damtp.cam.ac.uk>

	* Released 1.45.

	* Removed restriction of having only a single node at the top of
	the tree (associated with this, the top nodes should now be inserted
	with "insert", not with "append_child").

	* Fixes for ISO compatibility (now works with gcc-3.1). Thanks to
	Olivier Verdier.
